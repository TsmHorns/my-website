        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ian Grant. I am a computer programmer with over 10 years of experience in technology and programming. I have been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember, and I love building tools and software that can help people and solve practical problems.</p>
        <p>Beyond programming, I hold a black belt in Taekwondo, which reflects my disciplined, focused, and determined approach to both personal and professional challenges. This martial art has taught me the importance of perseverance, strategic thinking, and maintaining a balanced mindset.</p>
        <p>As a lifelong learner, I constantly seek to expand my knowledge and skills. My analytical nature drives me to delve deep into data, uncovering insights and patterns that inform decision-making. At the same time, I take great pleasure in presenting data in beautiful, meaningful ways that engage and unite audiences.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I am also a competitive person with a strong interest in esports. This competitive spirit motivates me to always look for ways to improve and excel in everything I do.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, and exploring new technologies. My passion for continuous learning and innovation motivates me to keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible, always aiming to create impactful and transformative solutions.</p>
